      <Para>
        Methods: <br />
        For the purpose of this project, I carried out secondary research
        (competitor analysis) and conducted user interviews that helped me
        understand the current market for a product like this and identify
        existing user pain points and possible solutions to these.
      </Para>
      <Para>
        Participants: <br />
        Half of the users using video streaming apps in the US are aged 18 to 44
        years (55%), compared to just 27 percent of those aged 45 or above. Most
        streamers (65%) stream on their smartphone, with most 66%) owning
        Android phones.
      </Para>
      <Para>
        With the rapid rise in users due to the continuing pandemic and people
        feeling disconnected and isolated as a result of months in lockdown,
        StreamNet would allow for users to stream content together while video
        conferencing. To further elevate the experience I will work on adding
        additional features to increase user engagement.
      </Para>
    </ParaWithHeaderLeft>
    <ParaWithHeaderLeft header="Ideation">
      <Para>
        Through conducting user interviews I was able to identify features that
        would be most useful to include in the app - the primary focus: having a
        video conferencing function while streaming content from popular
        platforms. I therefore began sketching out StreamNetâ€™s high level
        information architechture to put the must have features in context. The
        goal is a simple navigation with relevant content that will reduce
        information overload and enhance the user experience. I was able to
        sketch out solutions after identifying common UI patterns and
        interactions in similar apps.

        <Para>
          Develop an MVP for an app that allows streaming content from popular
          platform like Netflix, Prime Video, Hulu, etc while chatting/ video
          conferencing with friends and family.

      <ParaWithHeader header="The Solution">
        <Para>
          I designed an app with an easy to use interface that would allow
          streaming from popular platforms. The app serves two main functions -
          hosting watch parties or joining a party with a room code.

      I built out the UI Design by first thinking about how the content from
      different platforms would be displayed, how the user would host a party
      and finally a way to curate a watch list.

      I chose a shade of red to highlight all important elements in the app as
      it is associated with feelings of excitement and energy much like when one
      is watching a movie. As for the logo, I wanted to keep it simple and easy
      to remember.

      The website is designed to be responsive - ensuring the page is available
      and renders well on all devices. This ensures the brand can tap into the
      online e-ommerce market effectively.
